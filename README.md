# habatic
My first NestJS experience. The goal was to create my own habit tracker that it turns out... the Everyday app already does, exactly.

It was a fun learning experience and endeared me to NestJS a lot, but has no real value now aside from serving as examples for future devs. 

## oh noes, there be secrets!
No, there not be. There's a SendGrid key that has long since been revoked. Try it if you like, it won't do anything for you.
